Creates, fills and uses full-text indexes from differents sources listed in the 'data' directory using Whoosh python library. 


The goal of the project was to create a integrating system using the mediation approach to get, from a list of symptoms:
- the drugs that could cause them ALL as side_effects
- the drugs that could cure them ALL
- the diseases that could cause them ALL


Since it uses local data sources, the downloading of all the files could take a minute.

## How to use

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
